*Nothin really is~ certain in life.
*For~ some,
*things~ seem
*to stay the same~,
while for others, *they~ change unexpectedly.
We try to stay grounded,
but the reality is,
even the most constant things evolve.
Same paths diverge,
and they often lead us to places we never expected.
You *have to~ embrace it
and allow yourself to *change~ with time.
Again and *again~,
life presents new challenges.
*Hello~, you say, to a new beginning,
as you reconnect with *my~ old dreams.
An *old friend~ might return, offering wisdom and clarity.
*You~ realize that
no matter how much you *change~ externally—
whether it's your identity or perspective—
some part of you always remains, even if you change *your name~.
*But~, deep down, you understand that the core of your being endures.
You can’t pretend forever, and *not~ everything changes,
though *the way you~ see things may shift.
The ways you approach life evolve,
but how long can you continue to *play~
this game of *pretend~?
